## SUMMARY:
Based on the Collatz Conjecture, counts how many iterations it takes for any given number to 1 following the algorithm: n = n/2 if n is even, n = 3n+1 if n is odd.
Asks user to input an upperbound for inputs
Graphs the integer inputted along with the number of iterations needed for that integer to reach 1. Also displays the maximum number of iterations within upperbound.
Prints the input number and the iterations in the seq3np1 at the end.
